Transaction fees for Ã©ayments made through the shopify payments gateway (Shop Pay, Apple Pay, credit cards etc)
are not found in the order or transactions tables but in the shopify_balances as these fees are applied at the level of payouts
that aggregate different orders. The table contains data for orders, refund and the aggregated payouts.
Source_order_id is null for rows the correspond to payouts.
